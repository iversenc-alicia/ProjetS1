            <p>
                To understand the <em>state of women around the world</em>, <em>Joni Seager</em>'s The women's Atlas is more than an appropriate book. Indeed, this book is about the <em>injustices</em> that <em>women</em> suffer around the world.  It clearly shows how <em></em>important </em>feminism and its manifestations are. We are still far from equality. When one wants to travel to another country or is simply interested in the culture of other countries, it is important to <em>know the situation </em> of women in that country. Particularly if you are a woman.  In this article, we will focus on the country where Wakako comes from, Japan. 
            </p>

            <h2>Joni Seager</h2>
            <p>
                Joni Seager is a feminist, geographer, geopolitical expert and professor of mondial studies at Boston University. She is also a consultant at the 
                <a href="/AtlasDesFemems.html#glossaire__def1">

                </a>
                on gender and environmental issues.
            </p>

            <h2>Book’s structure</h2>

            <p>
                To give a general idea of the book, Seager divides it into <em>different chapters</em> : women around the <em>world</em>, holding women in their place, reproduction, body's policy, health, work, education and connectivity, property and poverty, and ends with its bibliography and index. This book gives <em> precise data on the status of women</em> in very specific contexts

            </p>

            <h2>A book about women around the world</h2>

            <p>
                This book is about <em>women who are in the shadows</em>. he ones who are usually not talked about, but who nevertheless are the <em>big majority</em>of women on the planet. It starts with the global gender index to give a <em>general view</em> of the situation around the world.

            <p>
                The global situation can be easily seen from this illustration. It can be seen that most of the <em>developed countries</em> are between <em>1 and 20 and then 21 and 55</em> in the world difference index. . However, <em>Asian countries</em> are mainly between <em>91 and 25</em>. Of course, it includes Japan, the country of <em>Wakako Fukuda</em>. Here is a <em>graph of discrimination</em> towards women around the world to clarify this.

            <h2>Allowed rapes</h2>

            <p>
                The book also points out aberrant things like the legal status of rape in different countries. In<em>Kowait</em>, a <em>rapist can escape his punishment</em> if he asks the woman that he abused to marry him and if her tutor agrees. Also in  <em>Tonga</em> if the <em> victim's parents approve</em>, the country allows the rape. The situation of women is totally variable from one country to another. One thing is certain: <em>feminism</em> must not stop. Thanks to feminists, different countries are applying <em>laws against rapes</em>. We can mention Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia in 2017 or Morocco and Bolivia in 2014.

            <h2>Are the numbers really true ? </h2>

            <p>
                Here is the map of the world with the percentage of <em>women victims of conjugal violence per country</em>. We can see that in <em>Japan 26%</em> of women are victims of domestic violence compared to <em> 25% in France</em>. So it's almost the same percentage of women who are victims in the two countries.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, as it has been told previously, <em>Japan does not allow as much freedom of speech </em> as Occidental countries do. So knowing the context, we must ask ourselves if Japanese women were really <em>honest</em>. when this poll was done. Even going further is possible, are some Japanese women even <em>aware</em> that they have been victims of <em>domestic violence</em>. Indeed, Japan does not put the individual first, particularly women. The group is the strength and on the contrary

                    <strong id="glossaire__mot2">individuality </strong> 
                </a>   
                s scary. Japan has a negative view of individualism. They don't really <em>let people speak up</em>,  so Japanese women often <em>stay silent</em>. . Even during the women's revolution, which allowed them to live more correctly, people talked about "silent revolution".
