            <p>
                <em>Wakako Fukuda</em> is not known in the way that other feminist figures are known. However, every feminist who acts is important. Indeed, it is by daring to call her/himself a feminist that more people will in turn become one. Equality between men and women will then become evidence. However, Wakako is still <em>the founder of a feminist movement </em>that is adapted to Japan. She is one of the extreme minority of Japanese women who dare to <em>protest </em>for their identity. But in a country where women are <em>supposed to be silent</em>,standing up is far from being easy.
            </p>
            <h2>Founder of a feminist movement adapted to Japan</h2>

            <p>
                During her trip to Germany, she became aware of the 
                <a href="/ENWakakoFukuda.html#glossaire__def1">
                    <strong id="glossaire__mot1">#MeToo</strong>
                </a>  movement. 
                When she came back to Japan in 2018, she founded the <em>feminist movement called "I am"</em>.It is a feminist movement that takes the <em>the very particular context of Japan.</em> into consideration.  It is important to understand that in Japan many women are not aware of being treated badly. The name of the movement is close to <strong>#MeToo</strong>.However, it is more focused on the individual and encourages women to have the courage to speak up for themselves.

            <p>
                Then, the fact that <em>Japan normalizes</em> many things that are considered unacceptable today in the Occident  must be taken into. Many examples are citables. The many women  who are <em>followed daily to their homes</em>on a much bigger scale than in France  because the Japanese men are often too "shy" to speak to them and prefer to follow them. There are also<em>metro cars and stairways only for women </em> because there are too many<em> sexual abuses</em>. So it is essential in Japan that women make their own voices heard, but for many, they stay silent. That is why, among this silence, Wakako's voice echoes so much and makes her a crucial figure for Japan.

            <p>
                Many people do not consider a woman who goes out to protest for her rights as a feminist figure. But in Japan, in the middle of all this silence, raising your voice is far from easy. Women like Wakako Fukuda are determining forces.
            </p>

            <h2>Her complicated beginning in feminism
            </h2>

            <p>
                In a country like Japan, where we are not expecting a woman to express her opinions, there is a Japanese woman who does not hesitate to say out loud what she thinks. Her name is <em>Wakako Fukuda</em>. Japanese women are supposed to be quiet and respectful. It is in this context that Wakako evolves. She does not hesitate to lead big crowds of protestors and make speeches where she says things like 
                <q>
                    "I'd like to feel free to give life to a girl into a society that would be safe for her, in a country where she could express herself without any fear</q>. During her first manifestations she received <em>threats </em> like <em> "you deserve to be raped"</em>.hreats that show the hostile environment that women have to deal with every day. 

            </p>

            <h2>Childhood</h2>

            <p>
                <em>Wakako Fukuda</em>was raised in a classic family pattern. Her father is a journalist and her mother is a housewife. This is still a very common pattern in Japan compared to other developed countries. When she was young she would sometimes skip school to read books, especially <em>books on feminism</em>. She has read a lot of books by two famous Japanese feminists: <a href="/ENWakakoFukuda.html#NoeIto"><strong>Noe Itô</strong></a> and <a href="/ENWakakoFukuda.html#EimiYamata"><strong>Eimi Yamata</strong></a>. When she was a high school student she read about the law that was threatening the freedom of expression in Japan. Revolted, it was at that time that she started to go out into the streets to make her voice heard.<br />So it is pretty rare to see women like Wakako in Japan. Aware of her identity, she did not hesitate to inform herself when she was younger. Then she grew up affirming her demands in the middle of a heavy silence.

                <p class="galerie__text">Eimi Yamada is a writer and a mangaka born in 1959. She studied literature at Meiji University. Yamada's works appeared for the first time in the beginning of the modern period. Her first book was published in 1985 and it is called Bitter Voluptuousness. It is an autobiographical work in which she tells about one of her sexual passions. In a society that is mostly male-centred, Eimi Yamada is one of the first authors to write for women. Her writing can be seen as a sexual liberation for women. She published other novels showing a desire to show her sexual freedom, like in 1988 with "Kneel down and lick my feet".

She started a line about the problems that women faced in Japan's society at this time. In this, she talked about abortion, forced marriages and prostitution. Later, she became an advisor for the feminist and socialist organisation Sekirankai.
